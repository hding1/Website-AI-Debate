    <p>AI(Artificial Intelligence) is what we see all around us in computers today: intelligent systems that have been taught or learned how to carry out specific tasks without being explicitly programmed how to do so. Including many realistic applications: autonomous vehicles and machine learnings.</p>

    <h2>Artificial Intelligence History</h2>
    <p align="left"> &nbsp; The term artificial intelligence was coined in 1956, but AI has become more popular today thanks to increased data volumes, advanced algorithms, and improvements in computing power and storage.<br>
  &nbsp; Early AI research in the 1950s explored topics like problem solving and symbolic methods. In the 1960s, the US Department of Defense took interest in this type of work and began training computers to mimic basic human reasoning. For example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) completed street mapping projects in the 1970s. And DARPA produced intelligent personal assistants in 2003, long before Siri, Alexa or Cortana were household names.<br>
  &nbsp; This early work paved the way for the automation and formal reasoning that we see in computers today, including decision support systems and smart search systems that can be designed to complement and augment human abilities.<br>
  &nbsp; While Hollywood movies and science fiction novels depict AI as human-like robots that take over the world, the current evolution of AI technologies isn’t that scary – or quite that smart. Instead, AI has evolved to provide many specific benefits in every industry. Keep reading for modern examples of artificial intelligence in health care, retail and more.<br>

<h2>Why is artificial intelligence important?</h2>
<p> &nbsp; AI can help us to solve many problems in life, and also provide convenient lifestyles. It is a revolutionary technology in the modern society. But it also raises safety and economic concerns from a long term. Therefore, many voices emerged to discuss its future prospects.</p>

  <h3>Project Information</h3>
  <p>One debate will be given: four group members are separated into two groups, stand by it or against it. Each argument follows a thoughtful discuss based on an example. Our group will focus on how to define artificial intelligence and whether we should set a limit to further invest in AI technology. </p>
